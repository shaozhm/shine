This component is used to deploy the Fiori Launchpad portal site configuration (configuration of tiles, groups and catalogs) into the XSA environment. This component is coupled with the sap-site-entry node module, which in turn acts as the web entry server of the Fiori Launchpad portal site. This component uses the portal-service that exists in the environment.

This component can be used only on HANA XSA SP1 environment.
